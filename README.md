# minigrep (grep utility written in rust)

This is my implementation of `grep` as described in the 
`The Rust Programming Language` aka `The book` for Rust.

## Features:
- Takes filename and pattern to search as cli args
- Reads the file line by line
- Find all the lines which satisfies the pattern
- Print those lines

> Note. This is not tool to be used in production, this is just
> a implementation described as part of Rust tutorial
